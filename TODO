NOW
[X] add input Image Location
[X] AirFlick notification on Image Location change
[X] allow Image Location to be a remote URL as well (take from SpectreSupreme)
[X] shortcut AirFlick entirely and use HTTP info directly:
    https://github.com/norio-nomura/SendToAirFlick
[X] Apple TV host input
[X] internally resize/recompress image when appropraite
[ ] profile image resizing and data delivery
[ ] use non-blocking read of image off disk via NSURLConnection
[ ] consider using GCD for image resize / recompress
[ ] migrate to ARC

LATER
[X] investigate JPEG compression options on resize
[ ] support password-protected Apple TV
[\] try Content-Location header for remote image locations
    the /photo action only accepts image data, not references
[ ] add Image input and manage details internally
[X] consider making my own simple block-based wrapper on NSURLConnection
[\] prepopulate Apple TV options via zero-conf _appletv-v2._tcp. or _airplay._tcp.
[\] consider using ASIHTTPRequest for simple block usage
    too big for such a simple task
[ ] take a look at other Apple TV events
    /reverse, /play, /scrub, /rate, /volume, /photo, /authorize, /server-info, /slideshow-features, /playback-info, /stop, /event
